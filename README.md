~~~~code and stuff~~~~give me free private repositories :(~~~~

hear ye hear ye,

ye listless souls who have come to this far-flung code island.
Abandon all hope of absolution, for this be code of the stranger sort.
naught but patches and remnants scrounged up from far away.

why are you here anyway?
